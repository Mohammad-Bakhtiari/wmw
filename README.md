# Mann-Whitney U Test Analysis for Model Comparison

This repository contains a Python script (`main.py`) to perform statistical comparison between two models (`FedscGen-SMPC` vs `scGen`) using the **Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW)** test.We performed a statistical comparison between the performance of FedScGen and scGen across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW) test. This non-parametric test is appropriate for assessing whether two independent samples are drawn from the same distribution.
For each metric-dataset pair, we compared performance scores from 10 independent runs (seeds) for both models, treating them as independent samples.
We formulated the null hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ) as the two samples being drawn from identical distributions, and the alternative hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ) as the samples coming from different distributions, indicating a performance difference. After computing the p-values for each comparison:
We applied the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction to control the false discovery rate (FDR) across multiple tests.
Metric-dataset pairs with an adjusted p-value < 0.01 were considered statistically significant.
We visualized the results in a heatmap, showing:
The average performance difference between models.
Statistically significant cells highlighted with stars (*) or color.

* Console Output: Number of significant metric-dataset pairs and their adjusted p-values (if < 0.05).

üß™ Statistical Test Description

The script performs the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (Mann-Whitney U) test to compare the distributions of performance scores from 10 independent runs (seeds) for each model. This non-parametric test does not assume paired observations or normal distribution and is appropriate for evaluating whether the performance of one model is stochastically greater than the other.
